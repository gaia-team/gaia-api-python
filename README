This is the python API for GAIA.

Make sure to have the "gaiadb-schemas" repo cloned into a dir at the same level as the "gaiadb-api-python" repo.  

Then run the ./gen.sh in the root directory to copy them into gaia/obj_defs/*.json

This will get you all the latest avro object definitions.

To install this package, run 'sudo pip install -e .'
